# AI-Powered Personalized Player Engagement System

## Overview
This repository contains an AI-powered personalized player engagement system tailored for gaming scenarios. It includes features like a recommendation model for in-game rewards and Generative AI for personalized content generation (text, images, etc.).

## Features
- A recommendation system built with TensorFlow/PyTorch for in-game purchases and player rewards.
- Integration with Generative AI models (e.g., GPT, Stable Diffusion) to generate:
  - Custom messages.
  - Themed promotional banners.
  - Avatars based on player data.
- FastAPI backend for deployment.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9=
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-player-engagement.git
   cd ai-player-engagement
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3.9 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   Ensure the `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary dependencies:
   - tensorflow
   - torch
   - transformers
   - diffusers
   - fastapi
   - uvicorn
   - scikit-learn
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib

   Then, install them:
   ```bash
   pip install -r app/requirements.txt
   ```
4. Generate synthetic data:
   ```bash
   python data/synthetic_player_data.py
   ```
5. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python app/model.py
   ```
6. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   python app/main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Access the FastAPI server at `http://localhost:8000`.
- Use endpoints to generate personalized player recommendations and content.

## Docker Setup (Optional)
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t player-engagement-system .
   ```
2. Verify the Docker image was built successfully:
   ```bash
   docker images
   ```
   You should see an image with the name `player-engagement-system` in the list.
3. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 player-engagement-system
   ```
